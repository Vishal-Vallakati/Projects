## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on monitoring and analyzing firewall logs from the **botsv2 data log set**, with queries and dashboards designed to provide insights into network traffic and security events. Below are the key scenarios analyzed:

### **1. Blocked Connections**
- Identifies all the connections that have been blocked by the firewall.
- Useful for detecting potential security threats, unauthorized access attempts, or misconfigurations.

### **2. Allowed Connections**
- Lists the connections that were allowed by the firewall.
- Helps to identify legitimate network traffic and validate security policies.

### **3. External Source IPs**
- Identifies external source IP addresses involved in traffic interactions with your network.
- Helps in detecting traffic originating from outside the network, which could indicate reconnaissance or potential attacks.

### **4. External Destination IPs**
- Shows external destination IP addresses receiving traffic from your network.
- Useful for monitoring outbound traffic and identifying potentially risky connections to external systems.

### **5. Line Chart Showing Allowed and Blocked Network Traffic**
- Provides a time-based visualization of allowed and blocked network traffic.
- Helps in tracking network activity trends over time and identifying any unusual spikes in allowed or blocked traffic.

Each query is written and optimized for the **botsv2 data log set** for the date range **August 10, 2016 to August 11, 2016** to extract actionable insights into firewall activity. The dashboards and saved searches make it easier to monitor network security, track blocked/allowed traffic, and detect any abnormal activity.
